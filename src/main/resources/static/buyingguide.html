        </header>
        <div>
          <h3 class="bold">Submitting your offer</h3>
          <p class="light">To submit an offer to purchase a property, your realtor will prepare paperwork that must be signed by you and delivered to the listing agent. When you submit an offer, you will choose the amount your want to purchase the home for and an “irrevocable” date and time. The seller has within this time period to either accept or “sign back” (make a counter offer).</p>
          <p class="light">The deposit amount varies on the purchase price, however as a standard rule multiply the purchase price by 5%. The deposit is to be delivered typically within 24 hours of offer acceptance.</p>
          <p class="light">You will choose the best closing date to recieve the keys and start your home ownership. You will also select the conditions on which your offer will be based on.</p>
          <h3 class="bold">Counter offer</h3>
          <p class="light">The Seller may choose to send back your offer with changes favourable to them, you can then choose to accept, reject, or counter those terms.</p>
          <h3 class="bold">Offer Date</h3>
          <p class="light">Certain sellers may choose to hold all offers until one day to review them. During this situation, all interested parties who whish to buy the properties must submit their best offer on that offer date. Each offer will be independent and private. The seller will choose the best offer, counter one offer, or reject all offers.</p>
          <h3 class="bold">Conditions</h3>
          <p class="light">When you submit an offer and it is accepted, there will often be conditions that need to be fulfilled before you can move forward. These might include your inspection condition or firming up your mortgage details. While the seller might accept your offer, it is considered conditional and therefore not “firm” until these items have been completed.</p>
